In designing a combinational circuit in Digital Logic Design (DLD), we use the elements like Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, Decoders etc. In this question we will consider the designing of Multiplexers only.

Multiplexer is a logical device with multiple inputs and only single output with select lines.

Ex: In a “ N X 1” multiplexer, we have N inputs, 1 output and ‘log N’ select lines.

We can implement a “M X 1” multiplexer using few “N X 1” multiplexers iff M > N. We ned to find that, how many level of design with multiplexers of size “N X 1” requires to develop a completely mature multiplexer of size “M X 1”. If not possible then print “Not Possible” as output.

Input Format

Input contains two integers M & N respectively.

Constraints

1 <= M <= 2000

1 <= N <= 1000

Output Format

Print the number of levels needed for mature implementation or “Not Possible”.
input 8 2
output 3
